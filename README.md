## **Project Summary**  

This project focuses on building a transaction-matching system and integrating it into a web application. It consists of three key phases:  

### **ðŸ”¹ Part 1: Transaction Matching Algorithm**  

Developed a function to intelligently match transactions with their most likely corresponding orders while handling missing or incorrect data efficiently.  

- Utilized **Fuse.js**, a powerful fuzzy-search library, to improve match accuracy and handle partial or inconsistent data and show the confidence percentage.
- Since perfect accuracy isn't always possible due to unknown error margins, the function prioritizes **the closest possible matches** using weighted scoring.  
- The function processes an array of orders and transactions and returns an object containing the matched results.  
 

### **ðŸ”¹ Part 2: Web Application Deployment**  
Packaged the matching functionality into a full-stack web application that allows users to input transaction data and receive matched results.  
- Built a **React + Tailwind CSS** frontend for a seamless user experience.  
- Developed a **Node.js + Express** backend to process the matching logic.  
- Users can submit lists of orders and transactions to see results dynamically.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Part 3: Feature Extension & UX Enhancement**  
Enhanced the application with additional functionality to improve user interaction and match verification:  
  - Designed a UI for users to **approve or reject** transaction matches.  
  - Implemented a **confidence percentage** to help users assess match accuracy and make informed decisions. Users can review each match and approve it accordingly.


## Getting Started

This project consists of two applications:

Frontend Application â€“ Built with React and Tailwind CSS.

Backend Application â€“ Built with Node.js and Express.

## Front End Application 
Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required packages:


```bash
cd frontend_app

npm install
```
Start the Development Server

Run the following command to start the React development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Back End Application

install dependancies 

Navigate to the backend directory and install the necessary dependencies:

Run the backend server using:

```bash
cd match-transactions

npm install

npm run start
```
The Applciation will be available at:

 http://localhost:3000/

For reference, I have added a **temporary JSON** at the bottom of the application. There are two JSON datasets:  
1. **Order JSON**  
2. **Transaction JSON**  

Alternatively, you can paste any custom JSON into the text area and click the **"Match Transaction"** button. The matching results will be displayed on the right-hand side.  

### **Result Page Details:**  
- Each result card includes a **confidence percentage** and **matching criteria**.  
- Users can **approve** or **deny** the match.  
- **Note:** The approve/deny actions are currently UI-based and do not trigger any API requests.
